                    Additional Information

                    What are sure bets and how to earn with sure bets?

                    Sure bets definition
                    Sure bet is always a real 100% chance of the win

                    A sure bet (also called a betting arbitrage or surebet) is an opportunity of betting which gives you
                    a one hundred percent chance of the win, and not only in theory. It consists in choosing the right
                    sport event and usually two (or sometimes three - in the case with the draw possibility) bookmakers
                    which give the highest odds for both of competitors. Then you can make sure bet at the first
                    bookmaker on the first competitor and at the second bookmaker on the second competitor (and
                    sometimes at the third bookmaker on the draw). If you have chosen the sport event (and bookmakers)
                    correctly you can distribute your money between bookmakers in the way you will have an income
                    independently of the result of the event. There are many different types of sure bets but the
                    simplest distinction is that sure bets (surebet) can involve a draw or not.
                    Very simple example for using sure bets

                    It’s a very simple example for using sure bets. Imagine there is a tennis event - a match between
                    Player A and Player B. The odds of one of bookmakers are 2,05 on Player's A win and 1,90 on Player's
                    B win. The other bookmaker's odds are 1,80 on Player A and 2,05 on Player B. It is clear without a
                    calculator that if you bet 100 USD on Player A at the first bookmaker and another 100 USD on Player
                    B at the second bookmaker you will win 205 USD regardless of the outcome of the match. It means that
                    your profit will be equal 5 USD because you bet 200 USD and win 205 USD. So the event and the
                    bookmakers' odds make a sure bet. You can use our betting calculator for making sure bets.
                    Sure bet usage - different ways to use sure bets

                    You can use sure bets in many ways.

                    you can use sure bets (surebet) for profit (usually but not always it is the small profit of 1 or 2
                    percents so you have to bet huge amounts to get a real income)
                    you can use sure bets (surebet) for currency exchange (if you have few accounts at different
                    bookmakers with different currencies). You may for example try to loose your Euro at one bookmaker
                    and instead gain some USD at the other.
                    you can use sure bets (surebet) for bonus circulation. Most bookmakers offer a bonus for new users
                    making a reservation that the user must stake the bonus sum for example for 3 times. It means that
                    when you will gain a bonus of 100 USD you will have to stake 300 USD together until you will be able
                    to withdraw the bonus sum. You may play the sure bets to circulate the bonus sum over and over
                    without a risk.


                    Sure bets risks and dangers

                    Sure bet is really a 100% chance of winning not only in a theory, but in fact there are some aspects
                    which you should consider about when you are using sure bets. The possible scenarios are when you
                    are playing sure bets:
                    A mistake by placing the wrong bet

                    When you are in a hurry (and that happens almost always when you are playing sure bets) it is easy
                    to make a mistake. You try to react quickly and you may click at the wrong event especially when you
                    do not have much experience in betting online. So be careful when you are playing sure bets.
                    Odds changes

                    The odds are changing all the time and your reaction should be as quick as possible. It means that
                    you may bet at the first bookmaker but in the meanwhile the second bookmaker changed his stakes or
                    even withdraws the event from his offer. So you should take this into your consideration when you
                    are playing sure bets.
                    Limit your stake amount

                    The most important thing is that the bookmaker knows which events make a sure bet. When he notices
                    that you play only sure bets he will start to limit your stake amount - mostly without a warning.
                    This happens usually after a few dozen of bets depending on the bookmaker. So you should also take
                    this into your consideration when you are playing sure bets.
                    Different bookmakers rules

                    The bookmakers rules may be different from each other. In case of an abnormal outcome of the event
                    (walkover, changing the playground, fan riots) you may for example loose money at one bookmaker and
                    get the stake back from the other - so it will be the loss on the whole. But you may sometimes win
                    the same event at every bookmaker only thanks to a bookmakers' rules differences. You should also
                    take this into your consideration when you are playing sure bets.
                    Obvious bookmaker's mistake

                    The bookmaker has made an obvious mistake. If the sure bet's profit is greater than a few percent
                    (let's say 5 percent) the bet becomes risky. You should remember that the bookmaker may always said
                    that the sure bet was a mistake and simply void your sure bet and returns you the stake. It is wise
                    not to play sure bets with suspicious great profits. Remember this when you are playing sure bets.
